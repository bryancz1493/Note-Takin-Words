# Note-Takin-Words

# Note Taker Starter Code

My challenge is to create an app that can be used to write and save notes, like a simplified version of Mircosoft Words. This application will use Express.js on the back-end to save and retrieve note data as a JSON file.

# User Story

AS a fresh start-up entreprenuer
I want to be able to write and save 
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts/schedule and keep track on daily tasks for further planning

# Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a note-taking application
WHEN I open the application
THEN I am presented with a blank page with a link to application
WHEN I click on the link
THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed 
WHEN I enter the title and text description
THEN a "save" and "clear" button will be shown
WHEN I click on the save button
THEN the notes will be created and saved
WHEN I click on existing note from the list
THEN the note will appear 
WHEN I click on "new" note
THEN I will be present an empty note template that was shown previously

# Mock-Up
